### Project description



### Analysis overview 

1. Processing of raw 450K array intensity data and estimation of 5hmC, 5mC, and C proportions. 
2. Characterization of the genome-wide distribution and abundance of 5hmC, and selection of *high 5hmC CpGs*. 
3. Tests of 5hmC enrichment among genomic features and gene sets
4. Analysis of relation between 5hmC abundance and breast-specific gene expression
5. Statistical comparison of overlap between *high 5hmC CpGs* and differentially methylated loci in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and breast tumor tissue
