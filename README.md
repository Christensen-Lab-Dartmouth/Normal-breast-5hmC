## Project description



## Analysis overview

* **01.Data_Preprocessing**
    1. Processing of raw DNA methylation intensity data (IDATs)
    2. Estimation of 5hmC/5mC proportions in normal breast tissue

* **02.Characterization_5hmC_levels**
    1. Genomic characterization of 5hmC distribution & abundance
    2. Selection of *high 5hmC CpGs* (CpG loci among top 1% in 5hmC abundance)

* **03.Enrichment_Analyses**
    1. Gene set enrichment of *high 5hmC CpGs*
    2. Tests of *high 5hmC CpG* enrichment among genomic features (promoters, exons, etc.)
    3. Tests of *high 5hmC CpG* enrichment among DNA regulatory regions (e.g. histone modifications)

* **04.Gene_expression**
    1. CpG-specific correlation analysis between 5hmC abundance & gene expression

* **05.Cancer_Comparison**
    1. Tests of *high 5hmC CpG* enrichment among differentially methylated CpGs between DCIS & adjacent-normal
    2. Tests of *high 5hmC CpG* enrichment among differentially methylated CpGs between tumor & adjacent-normal
