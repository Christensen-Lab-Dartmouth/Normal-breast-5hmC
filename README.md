## Project description



## Analysis overview

* **01.Data_Preprocessing**
    1. Processing of raw DNA methylation intensity data (IDATs)
    2. Estimation of 5hmC/5mC proportions in normal breast tissue
* **02.Characterization_5hmC_levels**
    1. Genomic characterization of 5hmC distribution & abundance
    2. Selection of *high 5hmC CpGs*
* **03.Enrichment_Analyses**
    1. Gene set enrichment of *high 5hmC CpGs*
    2. Tests of *high 5hmC CpG* enrichment among genomic features (promoters, exons, etc.)
    3. Tests of *high 5hmC CpG* enrichment among DNA regulatory regions
* **04.Nano_String**
    1. CpG-specific correlation analysis between 5hmC abundance & gene expression
* **05.Cancer_Comparison**
    1. Tests of *high 5hmC CpG* enrichment among differentially methylated CpGs between DCIS * adjacent-normal
    2. Tests of *high 5hmC CpG* enrichment among differentially methylated CpGs between tumor * adjacent-normal

1. 450K intensity data processing & estimation of 5hmC/5mC proportions.
2. Characterization of the genome-wide distribution & abundance of 5hmC, & selection of the *high 5hmC CpGs*.
3. Tests of 5hmC enrichment among genomic features & gene sets
4. Analysis of relation between 5hmC abundance & breast-specific gene expression
5. Statistical comparison of overlap between *high 5hmC CpGs* & differentially methylated loci in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) & breast tumor tissue
