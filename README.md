### Project description

NDRI

### Analysis overview

1. 450K intensity data processing and estimation of 5hmC/5mC proportions.
2. Characterization of the genome-wide distribution and abundance of 5hmC, and selection of the *high 5hmC CpGs*.
3. Tests of 5hmC enrichment among genomic features and gene sets
4. Analysis of relation between 5hmC abundance and breast-specific gene expression
5. Statistical comparison of overlap between *high 5hmC CpGs* and differentially methylated loci in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and breast tumor tissue

### Data availability
